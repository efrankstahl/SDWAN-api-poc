6/26 changelog: 
    - made new yaml file that includes product and other properties
        had to tab all the raw data stuff over
        ! maybe I don't have to use that one and can just manually fill in that data in the payload
        but let's not worry about yaml for a quick sec.
    MY ISSUE WITH YAML IS THAT:  How is a yaml file sent over api??? 

    - OKAY NO i'm going to write the functions to parse a dir of json dicts for now. 
    - and im probably not going to try to send that file over api... 
    -  EVENTUALLY preproc will get that data by sending a get to the stuff the gui sent to flaskapp??probably??
           at the from-gui url

    CHANGED:
        made a post request to to-template also trigger the create_doc_outline function 
        a get request to to-template now returns the results of create_doc_outline
        included a Path to the doc_v2.jinja2 file at top of app.py
            this functions as the template_str when you call create_doc_outline


    ((- now i'm gonna rewrite the loads and parse functions to handle a yaml and turn it into a dict... somehow.))
    ((- ? THEN should I set up the GUI Send to send that raw yaml file? ))

6/22:  in the new template_engine, the create_doc will take the api results as an arg, nto the load data object?
